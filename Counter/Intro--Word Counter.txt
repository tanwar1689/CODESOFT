Users can determine the word count of a given text using the Word Counter Java application. 
There are two ways to enter text into it: manually or by reading text from a file. 
The application makes use of a number of techniques to analyse the input text and give insightful word analysis.

When the software is run, the user is given the option of manually entering the text or selecting a file. 
The user can enter the text directly if they choose manual entry. 
They must supply the file path if they opt to provide a file.

The countWords method is then used by the application to determine the total number of words in the input text. 
Whitespace is used to divide the text into an array of words.
