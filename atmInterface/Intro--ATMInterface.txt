Users can check their account balance, make withdrawals, and make deposits using this Java program's basic ATM interface. 
With a menu-driven architecture, it offers a straightforward command-line user interface. 

Based on the success or failure of transactions, the program verifies user input and displays the necessary messages. 
The ATM object stores the account balance, and withdrawals are only allowed when the account has enough money. 
The program serves as a foundation for the development of more complex ATM systems.
